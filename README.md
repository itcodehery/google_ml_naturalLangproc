# Google Natural Language Example App

This is a simple example app that demonstrates the usage of Google Natural Language API for barcode scanning and text recognition. The app currently supports the following features:

1. Barcode Scanner: Use the app to scan barcodes and retrieve the associated information such as product details, pricing, or tracking numbers.

2. Text Recognition: Capture an image containing text and extract the text using the app's text recognition feature. This can be helpful for digitizing printed documents or extracting information from images.

## Future Enhancements

This app is currently limited to barcode scanning and text recognition features. However, there are several possibilities for expansion and improvement, including:

- Language translation: Integrate language translation capabilities to translate the recognized text into different languages.
- Sentiment analysis: Utilize Google Natural Language API to perform sentiment analysis on the extracted text.
- Entity recognition: Extend the app to identify and extract entities such as names, locations, and organizations from the recognized text.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the app to enhance its functionality.
